## Documentation

For information about running and running in dev mode, check out one of the below:

- [Bot Documentation](./bot/)
- [Web Documentation](./web/)

## Legacy Branch

The bot has been around for a while, and yes there are two versions of it running. The original version was created in javascript, and because of that it's kind of a pain to work in it.

So partial work was done to move some of the more intricate commands over to Typescript / Rescript. But there's still work to be done

You can check out the [legacy](https://github.com/hellos3b/sjbha-bot/tree/legacy/plugins) branch if you can't find your command on master.

## Why is half this repo in Typescript and half in Rescript?

I'm in the process of converting it to rescript, but it takes some time and often I'm too busy.

This is also just a fun side hobby project. I often use it to practice some patterns or try new things
